##UI-Kits
The UI Kit used for this project is the Argon Design System created by creative Tim.  I used his styling sheets as our base but modified all the files to fit my project.


# Future-Goals:
- I would like to later add a map feature to display multiple events on a single map with a clickable feature to display events.
Another feature to add is modifying events based on kid's age.
- I would also like to implement another feature that allows parents to save events.
- Google oAuth is also something I'd like try out, since I already have the client side ready for it.
